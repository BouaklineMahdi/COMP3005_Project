ATTRIBUTE DESIGN DECISIONS:

1. Names stored as single text field (not composite)
   - Rationale: Simplicity; international names vary in structure

2. Single phone number per user
   - Rationale: Primary contact only; additional numbers not required

3. No derived attributes shown
   - Rationale: Calculations done in application layer, not database

4. Email as unique identifier
   - Rationale: Business rule requires unique email per user
