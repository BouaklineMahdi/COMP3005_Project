## Schema Normalization: 2NF and 3NF Compliance

All tables in our schema satisfy **Third Normal Form (3NF)**, which includes compliance with both 1NF and 2NF.

---

## 1. First Normal Form (1NF)

**Requirement:** All attributes contain atomic values, no repeating groups.

**Proof:**
- All attributes store single values (TEXT, INTEGER, NUMERIC, DATE, TIMESTAMP)
- Example: `member.phone` stores one phone number, not an array
- No repeating groups (e.g., phone1, phone2, phone3)
- Multiple related values stored in separate tables (e.g., health metrics as separate rows)

**Status:** All 10 tables are in 1NF.

---

## 2. Second Normal Form (2NF)

**Requirement:** No partial dependencies (non-key attributes must depend on entire primary key).

**Proof:**

**Tables with single-column PKs (10 tables):**
- Partial dependencies cannot exist with single-column PKs
- All non-key attributes depend on the entire (single-column) PK

- Example: `registered_at` depends on BOTH `member_id` AND `class_id` together
- Does NOT depend on `member_id` alone (different registrations for same member)
- Does NOT depend on `class_id` alone (different members register at different times)
- **No partial dependencies exist**

**Status:** All 10 tables are in 2NF.

---

## 3. Third Normal Form (3NF)

**Requirement:** No transitive dependencies (non-key attributes cannot depend on other non-key attributes).

**Proof:**

We verified each table to ensure no non-key attribute determines another non-key attribute.

**Key Example:**

**Member Table:**
- `email` does NOT determine `name` (email is unique but not used to derive other attributes)
- `dob` does NOT determine `name` (many people share birth dates)
- All attributes depend directly on `member_id`

**Similar analysis applies to all 10 tables** 

**Status:** All 10 tables are in 3NF.

## Summary

**Result:** Schema is fully normalized to 3NF, eliminating redundancy.
