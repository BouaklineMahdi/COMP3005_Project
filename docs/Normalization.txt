NORMALIZATION NOTES:

All tables are in Third Normal Form (3NF):

1NF: All attributes contain atomic values
  Example: phone stored as single value, not array

2NF: No partial dependencies
  Example: In ClassRegistration (member_id, class_id),
  registered_at depends on both keys together

3NF: No transitive dependencies
  Example: In Member table, email depends directly
  on member_id, not through another attribute

Result: No redundant data, efficient updates, data integrity maintained
